### Hi there 👋 

✨✨
I'm currently seeking a remote job. Reach out to me (📫 az.abraao@gmail.com) if you consider hiring me 😊
✨✨

You will see some random repositories here 😅. This is because I'm always exploring new ideas that come to my mind. (I have a Trello with about 200 crazy ideas not tested yet 🙈).

I'm a [User Innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_innovation) guy, so I use to start building stuff for my self-improvement, like:
- 📈 [Better Reader](https://github.com/azabraao/better-reader) - it will help you  to read like I already did (1000 words per minute ⚡️)(ongoing)
- 📊 [Reviewer](https://github.com/azabraao/reviewer) - an old experiment for me to test my productivity.
- Among others...

And some others that are in private repos, like 
- 📖 [BiblePlan](https://download-bibleplan.netlify.app/) - a viral app with thousands of users across the globe already in four languages!  
- 🧠 [Fixer](http://fixer.cf/) - a web app that helps people to pass hard exams.
- ✏️ [Edit Mode](https://www.editmode.io/) - a nice Chrome Extension. (I sold it!! 💰)

And some other projects for clients that I did as a freelancer. 👨🏽‍💻

Most recent freelance project:
- [THIS PWA APP](https://amd-gesso-orcamento.vercel.app)! (Have a look at the draggable behavior of some elements. I loved to make it!!)


🌱 Currently learning: 
- Web3

⚡ Fun facts:
 - Before joining tech I was planning to be a classic pianist
 - I love to sing R&B
 - I have had a collection of telephone/credit cards since around my 6yo 👦🏻

If you want to find me somewhere else, I'm @azabraao on the whole web!
