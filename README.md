### Hey, I'm Abraão — a software engineer & entrepreneur based in São Paulo, Brazil.

I build tools that solve real problems and scale fast.

Currently:
- 🦘 **Roopairs** – full-time software engineer, shipping product at startup speed  
- 🙌🏼 **FaithTech São Paulo** – leadership team, building redemptive technology
- 🚀 **Bible Journey** – my favorite side project: 8k users active monthly  

I’m obsessed with creating things that automate, simplify, and elevate everyday life.  
Driven by [User Innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_innovation), I build for myself first — and let it scale from there.
